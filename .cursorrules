// Modular Code
// Break functionality into small, focused units (functions, classes, or modules) each with a single responsibility.
// Prefer reusing existing utilities over writing new one-off functions for each feature.

// Preserve README.md
// Do not modify README.md; all edits to project documentation must be done manually.

// Document PROJECT MILESTONES concisely
// When a feature is added or removed, append a one-line, very concise entry to PROJECTMILESTONES.md; never alter or delete existing lines.
